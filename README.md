Exploratory tests for python

## Running automated tests

```
pdm test # skip slow tests

pdm test --run-slow # skip slowest tests

pdm test --run-slowest # be prepared to wait 5 mins or so
```

## Jupyter notebooks

In the [jupyter](./jupyter/) dir there are several notebooks I have used to explore sympy.
